## Features

### Graphics/Textures
The game graphics are simple since they are just the elements shown on the console. We were planning to renovate it by using some graphic library. However, since this version is working flawlessly and we are in love with its minimalist look, we decided to go with this style.

### Basic Features
- Drawing the board (including cells, mines and flags).
- Changing the state of each cell when it is selected.
- Timer.
- Functions: `new game`, `change board dimensions`, `select a function from console screen`.
- Randomize positions of the mines.
- Receiving new position of the pointer (to select a cell) from console screen.
- Saving the current state of the board and loading in the next playing session.
- Saving high scores.

### Remarkable Features
- Change game board's size corresponding to the current gamemode in order to improve game experience.
- Prevent the first reveal of mine.
